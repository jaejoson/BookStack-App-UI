# BookStack-App-UI

Experimented using the digital design toolkit, Sketch, to create a login, loading, and main screen for my app. 
The main screen is where the majority of the app's functionality lies: the "bookstack" that holds the books, as well as adding, 
removing, updating, searching, etc. The design of the menu bar on the bottom of the screen is not completely set in stone, but
it will remain as the user scrolls through their "bookstack".
